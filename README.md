# üëÅÔ∏è Roblox Join Monitor

Not something of interest to me but a couple people asked me to make it so figured I'd just open source it on here. Uses roblox presence API to check if user is in game, if they are it alerts you through the webhook specified in [config.json](https://github.com/coincracker/roblox-monitor/blob/main/reqs/config.json).
